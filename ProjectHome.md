The primary goal of this project is to provide a library to convert NWC scores to MusicXML. Then, Noteworthy users will be able to share their scores with others scorewriters, especially free ones such as [MuseScore](http://musescore.org).
For the time being, the library support only NWCtxt and you need a copy of NoteWhorthy composer to save a NWC file to NWCtxt.

The converter is also available online as a webservice on Google App Engine at http://nwc2musicxml.appspot.com/
